#Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

##Overview
-In this lab, you will create virtual machines (VMs) and connect to them. You will also create connections between the instances.

##Objectives
-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
-Connect between the two instances.

##Task 2: Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console
 - List of of zones in our region
	gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

 -Set my default zone to the one I chose, 
	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

 -To create a VM instance called my-vm-1 in that zone
	gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \ //click Change and select Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).//
--subnet "default"


##Task 3: Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line
 -To display a list of all the zones in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you, enter this partial command gcloud compute zones list | grep followed by the region that Qwiklabs or your instructor assigned you to.
	gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

 -To set your default zone to the one you just chose, enter this partial command gcloud config set compute/zone followed by the zone you chose.
	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

 -To create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone, execute this command:
	gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"

 -To close the Cloud Shell, execute the following command:

exit

##Task 4: Connect between VM instances
 -To open a command prompt on the my-vm-2 instance, click SSH in its row in the VM instances list.
 -Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
	ping my-vm-1
 -Press Ctrl+C to abort the ping command
 -Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1
	ssh my-vm-1
 -At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
	sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
 -Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
	sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
 -Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
	Hi from MICHAEL
 -Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.
 -Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
	curl http://localhost/
 -To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
	exit
 -To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
	curl http://my-vm-1/
