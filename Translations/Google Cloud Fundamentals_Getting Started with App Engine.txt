#Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

##Overview
-In this lab, you create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google Cloud Shell.

##Objectives
-Initialize App Engine.
-Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell
-Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
-Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

##Task 1: Initialize App Engine
-Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region
	gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

-Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
	git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

-Navigate to the source directory:
	cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

##Task 2: Run Hello World application locally
-Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.
	sudo apt-get update

-Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
	sudo apt-get install virtualenv

-If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
	virtualenv -p python3 venv

-Activate the virtual environment.
	source venv/bin/activate

-Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
	pip install  -r requirements.txt

-Run the application:
	python main.py

-To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.

##Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
-Navigate to the source directory:
	cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

-Deploy your Hello World application.
	gcloud app deploy
-If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter
This app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration.

-Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
	gcloud app browse
-Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.
